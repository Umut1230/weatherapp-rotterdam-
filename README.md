Rotterdam Weather Dashboard

A ReactJS app showing Rotterdamâ€™s weather using local JSON data and Stormglass API (optional).
View 1-day hourly or 10-day daily forecasts with interactive charts for temperature, wind, pressure, and waves.
Simply place data-1day.json and data-10day.json in the public/ folder, run npm install and npm start to launch. 
The app always shows local data, so it works even without hitting the API, which is limited to 10 calls per day.
